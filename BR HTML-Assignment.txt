        The <section> tag can be nested within the <article> tag, dividing the content into groups. 
       Therefore, it is required to use <h1> -<h6> headings within the <article> and the <section> tags.

              It is very similar to hyperlinks and contains an underlying text that,
             when clicked, redirects to a new webpage.
   Markup language: A markup language is not necessarily a programming language.
                  Instead, it is used to apply formatting and layout to a simple text document.
